<Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload your audio training files">
1. Create a folder in your repo called `audio`.
2. Add dry acapella voice files to the `audio` folder.
3. Create the ```model.json``` file in the root of your repo. This file will contain the configuration for your model. The following is an example of a ```model.json``` file:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Sample Model",
    "description": "A custom voice model ready for training",
    "audio_directory": "audio"
  } 
  ```
4. Zip the `audio` folder and `model.json` file together.
5. Upload the zip file through the [Revocalize dashboard](https://www.revocalize.ai).
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Record your training audio through Revocalize">
Revocalize allows you to record your training audio directly through the dashboard. This is a great option if you don't have any audio files to train with.

Simply head to the [Revocalize dashboard](https://www.revocalize.ai) and click the "Record Audio" button. You will be prompted to record your audio. 
Once you are done, you can download the audio files and the `model.json` file will be automatically generated for you.

## Optimize your training data

Optimizing your training data will help you get the best results from your custom voice model. 
We recommend the following guidelines when preparing your training data files:

- **Use dry acapella voice files** - This means that the audio files should not contain any background music or sound effects (e.g. reverb, delay, etc.).
- **Use high quality audio files** - The audio files should be recorded in a quiet environment with minimal background noise (e.g. no traffic, no wind, etc.). Ideally the audio files should be recorded in a professional studio.
- **Use a consistent volume level** - The volume level of the audio files should be consistent across all files (e.g. no clipping, no distortion, etc.).
- **Use a consistent sample rate** - The sample rate of the audio files should be consistent across all files (e.g. 44.1kHz, 48kHz, etc.).
- **Use a consistent bit depth** - The bit depth of the audio files should be consistent across all files (e.g. 16-bit, 24-bit, etc.).
- **Use a consistent file format** - The file format of the audio files should be consistent across all files (e.g. WAV, AIFF, etc.).
