title: "Setup Authentication"
description: "To get started using the Revocalize API, you'll need to generate an API Key through your Revocalize dashboard: [www.revocalize.ai/api-keys](https://www.revocalize.ai/api-keys)."
---

Tokens must be included in the ```Authentication``` HTTP header in all requests as a type ```Bearer```.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <revocalize_api_key>'
```

Test everything is working correctly using the ping endpoint and curl:

```bash Ping Test
curl -H "Authentication: Bearer " https://api.revocalize.ai/ping
{"ping":"pong"}
```
